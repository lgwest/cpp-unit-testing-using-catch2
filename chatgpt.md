## **question 1: vs code warns about missing build type** 
what does this message from vs code mean:  
[cpptools] The build configurations generated do not contain the active build configuration. Using "" for CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE instead of "Debug" to ensure that IntelliSense configurations can be found 

**answer 1:**

This message from VS Code indicates that there is a mismatch or inconsistency between the **build configurations** specified in your `CMakeLists.txt` or your **CMakePresets.json** and the configuration VS Code's **CMake Tools** extension is expecting or using for IntelliSense.

### **Breaking it Down:**
- **"The build configurations generated do not contain the active build configuration":**
  - This means the active build configuration (e.g., "Debug") you selected in VS Code doesn't match any of the configurations specified or generated by CMake during the configuration process.

- **"Using '' for CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE instead of 'Debug'":**
  - Since no match was found for the active configuration, VS Code falls back to using an empty value (`""`) for `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`, effectively defaulting to an unconfigured or generic state.
  - This can lead to issues with IntelliSense because it relies on the proper build configuration (e.g., "Debug", "Release") to set up include paths, defines, etc.

---

### **Common Causes**
1. **No `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` is specified:**
   - If your `CMakeLists.txt` or CMake presets do not define a build type explicitly, CMake defaults to an empty build type.
   - This is typical for multi-config generators like **Ninja Multi-Config** or **Visual Studio**, where the build type is determined at build time rather than configuration time.

2. **Mismatch between VS Code and CMake configurations:**
   - The active configuration selected in VS Code (`CMake: Select Configure Preset` or `CMake: Select Build Preset`) does not match the generated configurations in your `CMakeLists.txt` or `CMakePresets.json`.

3. **Missing or improperly set presets in `CMakePresets.json`:**
   - If you are using **CMake Presets** but the active configuration in VS Code does not correspond to a valid preset.

4. **Custom `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` not recognized:**
   - You may have defined a custom or non-standard build type (e.g., `CustomDebug`), which isn't recognized by IntelliSense.

---

### **How to Fix**
#### **1. Specify `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` in `CMakeLists.txt` (for single-config generators):**
   If you are using single-config generators like **Ninja** or **Makefiles**, set `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` explicitly in your `CMakeLists.txt`:
   ```cmake
   if(NOT CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE)
       set(CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE Debug CACHE STRING "Build type" FORCE)
   endif()
   ```

#### **2. Use CMake Presets and ensure they include the active configuration:**
   - Edit your `CMakePresets.json` to ensure it includes the "Debug" configuration or any other configuration you need.
   ```json
   {
     "version": 3,
     "configurePresets": [
       {
         "name": "debug",
         "generator": "Ninja",
         "binaryDir": "${sourceDir}/build",
         "cacheVariables": {
           "CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE": "Debug"
         }
       }
     ]
   }
   ```
   - Select the preset in VS Code by running `CMake: Select Configure Preset` from the Command Palette.

#### **3. Match IntelliSense configuration with build configuration:**
   - Run `CMake: Configure` and ensure that IntelliSense is aligned with the selected build type.
   - If the build is successful but IntelliSense still shows issues, rebuild the IntelliSense cache by running `CMake: Reset IntelliSense Database`.

#### **4. Multi-config generators:**
   - If you are using multi-config generators like **Ninja Multi-Config** or **Visual Studio**, ensure you select the appropriate build type during the build process. You can specify it explicitly in VS Code with the `CMAKE_DEFAULT_BUILD_TYPE` variable:
     ```json
     {
       "cacheVariables": {
         "CMAKE_DEFAULT_BUILD_TYPE": "Debug"
       }
     }
     ```

---

### **Summary**
This issue occurs because the active build configuration in VS Code (`Debug`, `Release`, etc.) does not align with the configuration CMake generated or expects. By aligning your `CMakeLists.txt`, `CMakePresets.json`, and VS Code's settings, you can resolve the discrepancy and ensure IntelliSense functions properly.

## **question 2: why use cmake cache variables**

why shall I save CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE as a cache variable?

Saving `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` as a **cache variable** in CMake ensures that its value persists between CMake configurations and reconfigurations. This is particularly important for single-config generators (like **Makefiles** or **Ninja**) that rely on `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` being set at configuration time to determine the active build configuration (e.g., `Debug`, `Release`).

Here's why you might want to save it as a cache variable:

---

### **1. Persistence Between Runs**
When you set a regular CMake variable, it only exists for the duration of the current CMake configuration. By saving `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` as a **cache variable** using the `CACHE` keyword, its value is stored in CMake's cache (`CMakeCache.txt`) and reused in subsequent runs.

#### Example:
```cmake
set(CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE Debug CACHE STRING "Build type")
```

- **Benefit**: If you reconfigure or modify other parts of your CMake project, the build type remains set unless explicitly changed.
- **Without Cache**: The value of `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` would need to be reset every time you configure the project.

---

### **2. Integration with IDEs and Tools**
Modern IDEs and tools, such as Visual Studio Code with the **CMake Tools** extension, often read `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` from the cache. If it's not stored as a cache variable, the IDE may not recognize the build type, leading to issues like incorrect IntelliSense configurations.

---

### **3. Multi-user and Build System Consistency**
Saving it in the cache ensures that all users and automated build systems use the same build type consistently, especially when generating build files in different environments.

---

### **4. Explicit User Control**
When saved as a cache variable, users can override `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` directly from the command line or with a GUI CMake configuration tool, like `ccmake` or `cmake-gui`.

#### Command-line example:
```bash
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
```

---

### **When Shouldn't You Cache `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`?**
You generally shouldn't cache `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` if:
1. You're using a **multi-config generator** (e.g., Ninja Multi-Config, Visual Studio, Xcode). These generators do not rely on `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` since they support multiple build configurations simultaneously.
2. You need the build type to change dynamically at runtime for some reason (rare use case).

---

### **Best Practices**
- Use `CACHE` for single-config generators to persist and standardize build configuration:
  ```cmake
  if(NOT CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE)
      set(CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE Debug CACHE STRING "Build type" FORCE)
  endif()
  ```
- For multi-config generators, rely on the IDE or build tool to select the active configuration instead of setting `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`.

By caching `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`, you ensure a stable, consistent configuration for single-config generators, simplifying both development and automated builds.
